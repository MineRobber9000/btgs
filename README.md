An extendable Gemini server in Python.

## Why did you make a new repo?

Honestly, I decided to start over from scratch rather than work on the foundation of the original.

## Roadmap

 - [X] Handle gemini requests
    - [X] Static file serving
      - [ ] CGI scripts?
    - [ ] Server-side scripting
      - [ ] Similar to how Jetforce does the application thing?
      - [ ] Allow for a bit more extensibility
 - [ ] Add mixins for certain other gemini-adjacent protocols
    - [ ] Titan
    - [ ] Inimeg
    - [ ] Dioscuri
    - [ ] Iapetus
